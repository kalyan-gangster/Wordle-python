# HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### Hardware Requirements
* **Processor**: 1.5 GHz or higher.
* **RAM**: 1 GB minimum.
* **Hard Disk**: 100 MB of available space.
* **Input**: Standard Keyboard and Mouse.

### Software Requirements: Modules Required
* [cite_start]**Pygame**: The core module used for building the game, providing functionalities for creating the window, handling events, and managing graphics[cite: 12, 13].
* [cite_start]**Sys**: Used to exit the game safely when the program ends or when the user chooses to quit, ensuring proper termination[cite: 14, 15].
* [cite_start]**Random**: Provides functions for generating random values to introduce unpredictability, such as selecting a random target word for each session[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Time**: Helps in controlling the frame rate and managing delays in the game loop to ensure it runs smoothly and consistently[cite: 17, 18].
* **OS**: Used to interact with the operating system for file pathing and managing game assets.
* **Math**: Used for performing mathematical tasks required for UI positioning and scaling.
