# HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### Hardware Requirements
* **Processor**: 1.5 GHz or higher.
* **RAM**: 1 GB minimum.
* **Hard Disk**: 100 MB of available space.
* **Input**: Standard Keyboard and Mouse.

### Software Requirements: Modules Required
* **Pygame**: The core module used for building the game. It provides functionalities for creating the game window, handling events (keyboard/mouse input), managing graphics, updating frames, detecting collisions, and controlling game flow.
* **Sys**: Used to exit the game safely when the program ends or when the user chooses to quit. It ensures proper termination of the application.
* **Random**: Provides functions for generating random values. This module is used to introduce unpredictability in the game, such as random selection of the target word, which makes gameplay more dynamic.
* **Time**: Helps in controlling the frame rate and managing delays in the game loop. It ensures that the game runs smoothly and consistently across different systems.
* **Math**: Utilized for performing mathematical calculations required for precise coordinate placement and UI scaling.
* **OS**: Used to interact with the operating system for handling file paths, ensuring the program can correctly locate word lists and game assets.
